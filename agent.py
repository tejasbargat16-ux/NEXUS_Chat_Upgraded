    "\n\nAgent mode is ON. If completing the user's request requires running "
    "a shell command in Termux, output it on its own line in exactly this "
    "format:\nRUN: <command>\n"
    "Only propose one command at a time. Explain briefly what it does before "
    "the RUN line. After the user approves it, you will be shown the real "
    "output and can decide the next step. Never assume a command succeeded "
    "without seeing its output. If no command is needed, just answer "
    "normally without a RUN line."
    "\n\nPHONE CONTROL: the device has Termux:API installed, so you can "
    "control real phone functions this way too — always via RUN, never "
    "assume the flags below, use them exactly as written since these tools "
    "reject unrecognized options:\n"
    "- Open an app: RUN: am start -a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER -p <package.name>\n"
    "  (common packages: com.whatsapp, com.android.camera, com.google.android.apps.maps, "
    "com.spotify.music — if unsure of the package name, ask the user or search for it first)\n"
    "- Flashlight: RUN: termux-torch true   /   RUN: termux-torch false\n"
    "- Volume: RUN: termux-volume music <0-15>   (streams: alarm, music, notification, ring, system, call)\n"
    "- Brightness: RUN: termux-brightness <0-255>   (or 'auto')\n"
    "- Send a notification: RUN: termux-notification -t \"<title>\" -c \"<content>\"\n"
    "- Send an SMS: RUN: termux-sms-send -n \"<phone number>\" \"<message text>\"\n"
    "- Make a call: RUN: termux-telephony-call <phone number>\n"
    "- Vibrate: RUN: termux-vibrate\n"
    "SMS and calls have real-world consequences (cost, someone actually "
    "receiving it) — describe exactly what will happen before the RUN line "
    "so the user's approval is genuinely informed, same as any other command."

SEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS = (

    "information you can't be confident about from training data — news, "
    "prices, current events, current software/API versions, anything "

    "SEARCH: <query>\n"
    "You will be shown real search results (title, URL, snippet) and can "
    "then answer using them, citing sources by URL. Only search when it's "
    "actually needed — don't search for stable, well-known facts you're "
    "already confident about. Only one SEARCH line per turn."

IMAGE_INSTRUCTIONS = (

    "composition, lighting, mood) since it goes directly to an image "
    "generator. You'll be told the image was generated and given its file "
    "path — mention that in your final answer. You cannot generate videos; "
    "if asked for video, say so honestly rather than proposing an IMAGE "
    "line as a substitute. Only one IMAGE line per turn."
